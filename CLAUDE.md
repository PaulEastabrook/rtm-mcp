### Module Responsibilities

| Module | Single Responsibility |
|--------|----------------------|
| `client.py` | HTTP transport: signing, connection pooling, rate limiting, retry, settings caching (timezone + default list) |
| `parsers.py` | Translate RTM's quirky API responses into clean Python dicts |
| `response_builder.py` | Wrap tool output in the standard MCP response envelope |
| `lookup.py` | Resolve human-readable names (task name, list name) to RTM IDs |
| `strict_tags.py` | Strict-tag mode policy: normalize/split tags, extract SmartAdd `#tokens`, and gate tag writes against the account's existing tag set |
| `project_plan.py` | Pure (no IO) reconstruction of the `project-plan-seed/3` envelope from parsed tasks — byte-compatible with the gtd plugin's `rtm_fetch.py` reference |
| `canvas_seed.py` | Pure mapper: `project-plan-seed/3` envelope → canvas `{mode, frame, seed}` shape — byte-compatible port of the gtd plugin's `build-canvas-seed.py` |
| `plan_graph.py` | Pure deterministic plan-graph engine (DAG, blocked/quick judgement, tiered timeline order, cycles, fingerprint) — byte-compatible port of the gtd plugin's `plan_graph.py` |
| `canvas_overlay.py` | Pure merge of the plan-graph overlay onto the seed (`apply_graph`) + the lean/inline transform (`lean_seed`) — port of the gtd plugin's `build_canvas.py` helpers |
| `canvas_commit.py` | Pure closed canonical classifier→tag mapping + commit validators (`validate_commit`, `collect_commit_tags`) for `gtd_apply_canvas_commit` |
| `companion.py` | The vault file-IO seam: locate the read-only AI Memory vault root (cross-platform; `AI_MEMORY_DIR`/host default + `memory/_index.md` marker), resolve each filed artefact's companion (`.md`/`.yaml`) frontmatter, and enrich `gtd_project_canvas` file objects with a `meta` block. Mirrors file-store's `query_outputs.py` by contract (stdlib-only). Graceful: every IO failure → no `meta`, never raises |
| `tool_params.py` | Shared coercion for complex (array/object) MCP params: a `coerce_json` `BeforeValidator` + `Annotated` types presenting a clean single-typed JSON schema (no `anyOf`/null) so clients that stringify union-typed params still interoperate |
| `exceptions.py` | Map RTM error codes to typed exceptions with recovery hints |
| `urls.py` | Build RTM web UI deep-link URLs; walk parent_task_id chain for hierarchy |
| `rate_limiter.py` | Token bucket pacing + rolling-window diagnostics |
| `tools/*.py` | Register MCP tools — thin glue between `client`, `parsers`, and `response_builder` |

## Key Patterns

### Tool Registration

Tools are registered via functions that receive the mcp instance and a client getter:

```python
def register_task_tools(mcp: Any, get_client: Any) -> None:
    @mcp.tool()
    async def list_tasks(ctx: Context, filter: str | None = None) -> dict:
        client: RTMClient = await get_client()
        result = await client.call("rtm.tasks.getList", filter=filter)
        return build_response(data=parse_tasks_response(result))
```

### Response Format

All tools return a consistent envelope:

```python
{
    "data": {...},                    # Main response data
    "analysis": {"insights": [...]},  # Optional insights (e.g. list_tasks)
    "metadata": {
        "fetched_at": "ISO timestamp",
        "transaction_id": "...",       # Write ops only — for undo
        "transaction_undoable": True,  # Write ops only
        "timeline_id": "...",          # Write ops only
    }
}
```

### HTTP Transport

Reads use GET with query parameters. Writes (`require_timeline=True`) use POST with form data — RTM silently ignores some parameters (e.g. `note_title`) on GET.

```python
client = RTMClient(config)
result = await client.call("rtm.tasks.add", require_timeline=True, name="Task")
```

The client provides:
- **MD5 request signing** via `sign_request()` (shared by `RTMClient` and `RTMAuthFlow`)
- **Timeline management** for write operations
- **Token bucket rate limiting** (burst to 3 RPS, sustain ~0.9 RPS)
- **HTTP 503 retry** with escalating backoff (2s → 5s, max 2 retries)
- **Connection retry** for transient errors (timeout, DNS, TCP reset) with configurable backoff
- **Settings caching** via `client._get_settings()` — fetches `rtm.settings.getList`
  once per session; `get_timezone()` and `get_default_list_id()` both read from this
  single cached dict (one API call serves both)
- **Account-tag caching** via `client.get_account_tags()` — normalized (trim + lower)
  set of existing account tags from `rtm.tags.getList`, cached with a short TTL
  (`ACCOUNT_TAGS_TTL_SECONDS`, 5 min); `force_refresh=True` bypasses the cache. Backs
  strict-tag mode's allow-list (see below)
- **Error code mapping** to typed exceptions with recovery hints

### Rate Limiting and Connection Retry

Uses a **token bucket** (`rate_limiter.py`) matching RTM's stated limits:

| Parameter | Default | Env var |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Bucket capacity | 3 tokens | `RTM_BUCKET_CAPACITY` |
| Safety margin | 10% | `RTM_SAFETY_MARGIN` |
| Refill rate | 0.9 tokens/sec (= 1.0 - margin) | Derived |
| Max 503 retries | 2 | `RTM_MAX_RETRIES` |
| First 503 retry delay | 2s | `RTM_RETRY_DELAY_FIRST` |
| Subsequent 503 retry delay | 5s | `RTM_RETRY_DELAY_SUBSEQUENT` |
| Max connection retries | 3 | `RTM_CONN_MAX_RETRIES` |
| First connection retry delay | 1s | `RTM_CONN_RETRY_DELAY_FIRST` |
| Subsequent connection retry delay | 3s | `RTM_CONN_RETRY_DELAY_SUBSEQUENT` |

**Connection retries** are handled by `_attempt_http()` which wraps the HTTP dispatch:
- `ConnectError` (TCP, DNS) — retried for both reads and writes (connection never established)
- `TimeoutException` on reads — retried (safe to replay)
- `TimeoutException` on writes — **not retried** (request may have been processed, risking duplication)
- TLS certificate errors — never retried
- Connection retries do **not** consume additional rate limit tokens

Request classification uses `require_timeline` as a proxy: `True` = write, `False` = read. This correlates 100% with actual read/write status across all tools.

### Error Handling

Two layers of error handling:

**RTM API errors** — `raise_for_error()` in `exceptions.py` maps RTM error codes to exception classes (`RTMAuthError`, `RTMValidationError`, `RTMNotFoundError`, etc.) and appends recovery guidance from `ERROR_GUIDANCE`:

```python
# exceptions.py
ERROR_GUIDANCE: dict[int, str] = {
    98: "Re-run rtm-setup to get a fresh auth token.",
    340: "Call get_lists to see available list names.",
    341: "Call list_tasks to find the correct task name or IDs.",
    4040: "Subtask features require an RTM Pro account.",
    # ... 18 codes total
}

def raise_for_error(code: int, message: str) -> None:
    error_class = ERROR_CODE_MAP.get(code, RTMError)
    guidance = ERROR_GUIDANCE.get(code)
    full_message = f"{message} — {guidance}" if guidance else message
    raise error_class(full_message, code)
```

**Application-level errors** — `resolve_task_ids` and `resolve_list_id` (in `lookup.py`) and tool functions return actionable error messages via `build_response(data={"error": ...})` that guide agents to the correct next step:

```python
{"error": "Task not found: 'Buy milk'. Use list_tasks to search by filter or check spelling."}
{"error": "Provide either task_name (for search) or all three: task_id, taskseries_id, and list_id. Get these from list_tasks."}
{"error": "List 'Projects' not found. Use get_lists to see available list names."}
```

### Task and List Identification

RTM uses three IDs for task operations:
- `list_id`: Which list the task is in
- `taskseries_id`: The task series (for recurring tasks)
- `task_id`: The specific task instance

Tools accept either `task_name` (fuzzy search) or all three IDs. **Fuzzy matching** (`lookup.py:find_task`) searches incomplete tasks, preferring exact matches over substrings and more recently modified tasks over stale ones. All tool docstrings include a caution that fuzzy matching may hit unintended tasks.

List tools accept `list_name` which is resolved to `list_id` via `lookup.py:resolve_list_id`.

### Subtask Hierarchy

RTM supports parent/child task relationships (Pro required, max 3 levels):

- **`parent_task_id`** is extracted from the `taskseries` element (not `task`) and appears as empty string for top-level tasks — the parser normalises this to `None`
- Subtasks are sibling taskseries entries under the same list, NOT nested inside their parent
- **`subtask_count`** is computed client-side from the current result set via `_apply_subtask_counts()` — it does not make a secondary API call
- `list_tasks` accepts a `parent_task_id` parameter: it injects `isSubtask:true` into the server-side filter, then applies client-side filtering by parent ID
- `add_task` accepts `parent_task_id` to create a task as a subtask
- `set_parent_task` reparents a task or promotes it to top-level (pass empty `parent_task_id`)
- If the parent is in a different list, the task is **implicitly moved** to that list
- Repeating tasks cannot be parents or children of other repeating tasks
- `isSubtask:true` is an **undocumented** RTM filter — client-side filtering by `parent_task_id` is the reliable fallback
- RTM error codes: 4040 = Pro required, 4050 = invalid parent, 4060 = max nesting exceeded, 4070 = repeating task conflict, 4080 = due date before start date, 4090 = self-parenting

### Strict-Tag Mode (existence gate)

A control (`config.strict_tags`, env `RTM_STRICT_TAGS`, **on by default**; set
`RTM_STRICT_TAGS=0` to disable) that refuses any tag write which would introduce a tag not
already present in the RTM account. RTM auto-creates a tag on first use, so this is the
chokepoint that stops accidental tag minting via the MCP.

**Design — deliberately decoupled.** The runtime allow-list is simply the account's
current tag set (`client.get_account_tags()`), read live from RTM. The server has **no
knowledge of any canonical taxonomy and needs no sync** — "is this an *allowed* tag?"
(canonical policing) stays plugin-side; the server only enforces "does this tag *exist*?".

**Components:**
- `strict_tags.py` — pure policy: `normalize_tag` (trim + lower), `split_tags`
  (comma-split → normalized, de-duped), `extract_smartadd_tags` (regex `#tokens` from a
  SmartAdd name), `guided_error` (the self-documenting rejection), and
  `enforce_strict_tags(client, requested, *, tool)` → returns a guided-error dict to
  reject or `None` to allow.
- `client.get_account_tags()` — the TTL-cached, normalized allow-list (see HTTP Transport).

**`enforce_strict_tags` flow:**
1. `if not client.config.strict_tags: return None` — zero-cost when off (no API call).
2. Drop empties; no tags → allow.
3. Compare requested against `get_account_tags()`. On a miss, **re-fetch live**
   (`force_refresh=True`) and recompare — cache-miss safety so a tag created moments ago
   out-of-band isn't falsely rejected.
4. Still offending → `logger.info(...)` and return `guided_error(offending)`; else allow.

**Wiring (`tools/tasks.py`):** `add_task` (when `parse=True`, on `extract_smartadd_tags(name)`),
`add_task_tags` and `set_task_tags` (on `split_tags(tags)` — for `setTags` the resulting set
*is* the passed tags). `remove_task_tags` is **never** gated (removal reduces entropy).

**Caveats:**
- `extract_smartadd_tags` is a documented best-effort approximation of RTM's SmartAdd tag
  tokenizer. Over-matching a stray `#word` is intentional (it's the accidental-minting case);
  the guided error tells the caller to re-issue with `parse=False` or fix the name.
- **Testing gotcha:** the `mock_client` is an `AsyncMock`, so `client.config.strict_tags`
  is a *truthy Mock* unless set — the `test_task_tools.py` fixture sets
  `client.config = MagicMock(strict_tags=False)` so tag-write tests behave as today; strict
  tests flip it True and stub `client.get_account_tags`.

### GTD domain tools & the `gtd_project_plan` envelope

`gtd_project_plan` (`tools/gtd.py`) is the server's first **domain-composition** tool — it
speaks a consuming domain's language (a GTD "project plan") rather than mapping 1:1 to an RTM
method. **Naming convention:** generic RTM primitives stay bare verbs (`add_task`,
`list_tasks`); domain compositions carry a `<domain>_` prefix (`gtd_<concept-noun>`), so the
tool list self-documents the split and a future lift of all `gtd_*` tools into a separate
server is mechanical. Document new domain tools the same way.

**Read-only & single-call:** the tool issues exactly one `rtm.tasks.getList`
(`filter="status:incomplete OR status:completed"`, optionally `list_id`-scoped) — no timeline,
no writes (a test asserts the call surface) — then resolves the project and reconstructs the
tree in memory. No `rtm.settings.getList` (the envelope is date-only — no tz conversion).

**`project_plan.py` (pure) is byte-compatible with the gtd plugin's `rtm_fetch.py`** reference
(`reconstruct`/`to_ndjson`), the frozen `project-plan-seed/3` contract the canvas mapper
consumes. Verified by feeding one live `getList` response to both pipelines → identical
envelope. Server-port adaptations that preserve output:
- note bodies via `parsers.extract_note_body` (server notes carry the body in `$t`, not `body`);
- `name`/`estimate`/`url` coerced to `""` (server parsing yields `None` for empties);
- permalinks reuse `urls.build_task_url` with an **id-based** ancestor chain (`_ancestor_chain`)
  that includes an ancestor even when its row isn't in the fetched set — NOT
  `urls.walk_parent_chain`, which truncates at a missing parent and would drop the top segment.
- **tz caveat:** like the reference, `due`/`start`/`completedDate` are raw-UTC `[:10]`; a
  fixture generated by the older MilkScript path may show local dates a day off — a property of
  the reference, not this port (change both together if local dates are ever wanted).

### Canvas tools (`gtd_project_canvas` / `gtd_apply_canvas_commit`)

The project-plan **canvas** (a live artifact in the gtd plugin) reads and writes RTM through two
`gtd_` domain tools — the read-sibling and write-counterpart of `gtd_project_plan`.

**`gtd_project_canvas` (read-only)** returns the *rendered-shape* seed the canvas template
consumes directly, so the page never re-implements GTD ordering/blocking. It runs the same single
read-only `rtm.tasks.getList` as `gtd_project_plan`, then composes three **pure, byte-compatible
ports** of the gtd plugin's scripts:
- `canvas_seed.build_seed` ← `build-canvas-seed.py` — envelope → `{mode, frame, seed}`.
- `plan_graph.build_graph` ← `plan_graph.py` — the deterministic DAG/judgement/order overlay
  (v1 is mechanical-only: no vault, so `outputs_index=None`, `manual_order=[]` — edges come from
  active DEPENDS-ON notes alone).
- `canvas_overlay.apply_graph` / `lean_seed` ← `build_canvas.py` helpers — merge + inline profile.

  The merge stamps **only** `quick` (when `quick_ready`) and sibling `deps` (sorted) and reorders
  `seed[]` by the timeline order. It does **NOT** add a `blocked` or integer `order` field — the
  canvas template derives `blocked` from `deps[]`. (`lean=True`, the default, drops note bodies
  and caps notes per item with an honest `nc` — byte-compatible with `build_canvas --emit
  html-lean`.) Read-only invariant: only `rtm.tasks.getList`; no timeline, no writes.

  **Companion metadata (`file.meta`) + `frame.files`.** After the overlay/lean pass, `companion.py`
  enriches every file object — per-action `seed[*].files[]` **and** project-level `frame.files` —
  with a `meta` block: the artefact's companion (`.md`/`.yaml`) frontmatter (title/type/status/
  dates/authors/tags/decision/…), read from the **read-only AI Memory vault**. `meta` is a full
  pass-through of present top-level fields — **never** vocabulary-validated (real `type` values like
  `form-prefilled` pass through verbatim). Backward-compatible: `n/ext/kind/path` are unchanged;
  `meta` is added only where a companion exists, omitted otherwise. The reader mirrors file-store's
  `query_outputs.py` by contract, extended to resolve multiple companion forms (`X.meta.md` →
  `X.md` (non-md) → `X.companion.md` → `.companion/X.yaml` → `X.metadata.yaml`) and to read list
  fields (`authors`/`tags`) the reference parser skips. `frame.files` is the project-level
  support-material roll-up: filed paths scraped from the **project's own** notes
  (`project_plan.build_envelope` now also emits `header.project.files`, additive to the
  `project-plan-seed/3` envelope — `rtm_fetch.py` parity is an upstream follow-up), mapped via
  `parse_file` in the `outputs_index is None` branch.

  **Vault resolution (`companion.resolve_vault_root`)** mirrors the agent-memory plugins,
  cross-platform via `pathlib` (macOS + Windows, no OS branching): explicit override
  `config.vault_root` (env `RTM_VAULT_ROOT`, preferred, or the shared `AI_MEMORY_DIR`) → Cowork
  sandbox mount (`/sessions/*/mnt/AI Memory`) → host default `~/Documents/AI Memory`; each
  validated by the `memory/_index.md` marker. An explicit-but-invalid override does **not**
  fall through (honest no-op). Unset/absent vault ⇒ no `meta`, no error — the read-only invariant
  holds (companion reads are filesystem-only; still only `rtm.tasks.getList` hits the API).

**`gtd_apply_canvas_commit` (constrained write)** is the single governed write surface for a
canvas commit — safe by construction (artifacts call connectors without prompting). It runs
**validate-then-apply**:
- *Validate (no writes):* one read of the project tree → `plan_ids`; resolve the `Processed`
  list (must exist and be non-smart); `canvas_commit.validate_commit` collects rejections
  (cross-project id, unconfirmed `completes`/`removes`, unknown add type, invalid execute value,
  smart-list target); a single `enforce_strict_tags` existence-gate pass over
  `collect_commit_tags(ops)`. Any rejection → return with **nothing written**.
- *Apply (durable-first):* `adds` (create on `Processed` → tags → priority → due → reparent
  last), `edits`, `execute` (writes `#ai_progress_requested`, + `#ai_deferred_pending_unblock`
  when the item is blocked — it does **not** execute AI work), `notes`, then `completes` /
  `removes` (RTM soft-delete), then a `COMMIT` audit note on the project. Each write records its
  transaction (so `batch_undo` works); per-op failures are captured and the batch continues.
- *Discipline:* tag writes use a **closed canonical classifier→tag mapping** (`canvas_commit`) +
  the strict-tag existence gate — the server holds no taxonomy (see Strict-Tag Mode). `order` is
  accepted but a **v1 no-op** (RTM has no sibling-order field; the `manual_order` pin needs vault
  write access — a later DC). Created/edited items carry `#ai_conversation`.
- *Complex-param contract:* the ops params (`order`/`edits`/`adds`/`completes`/`removes`/`execute`/
  `notes`) use the `tool_params` `Annotated` types — a **clean single-typed JSON schema** (no
  `anyOf`/null union, which some MCP clients serialise as a JSON string) plus a `coerce_json`
  `BeforeValidator`, with an in-body `coerce_json` belt-and-braces for callers that bypass
  pydantic. So the tool accepts both structured JSON and a JSON-string for any op.

## RTM API Quirks

### Response Normalization

RTM returns single items as dicts and multiple items as arrays. Use `ensure_list()` from `parsers.py`:

```python
from rtm_mcp.parsers import ensure_list

data = ensure_list(result.get("locations", {}).get("location", []))
# Always returns a list, even for single-item or empty responses
```

RTM also wraps arrays in dict containers (e.g. `{"tag": ["a", "b"]}`). Use `parse_nested_list()`:

```python
from rtm_mcp.parsers import parse_nested_list

tags = parse_nested_list(ts.get("tags", []), "tag")
# Handles: {"tag": "single"}, {"tag": ["a","b"]}, [], None
```

### Write Response Format

RTM returns different JSON structures for reads vs writes:
- **Read** (`getList`): `{"tasks": {"list": [...]}}`
- **Write** (`add`, `complete`, `setTags`, etc.): `{"list": {...}}`

`parse_tasks_response` handles both via fallback:
```python
task_lists = result.get("tasks", {}).get("list", [])
if not task_lists and "list" in result:
    task_lists = result["list"]
```

### Default List Resolution (tasks.add ignores settings.defaultlist)

RTM's `rtm.tasks.add` ignores the account's default-list setting when called without a
`list_id` — the task lands in the built-in Inbox (`7271150`), **not** `settings.defaultlist`
(the web UI's quick-add honors it; the API does not). `add_task` compensates: when no
`list_name` is given **and** the task is not a subtask, it calls `client.get_default_list_id()`
and passes the result as `list_id`. Subtasks are skipped (the parent's list governs). Falls
back to RTM's built-in Inbox only when no default is configured. The default is read from the
user's RTM settings, never hardcoded.

### List Flag Coercion (smart / locked / archived)

RTM returns list flags as the strings `"1"`/`"0"`. `parse_lists_response` coerces them to
bools, but `format_list` is **also** called directly on *raw* write responses (`add_list`,
`rename_list`, `archive_list`, `unarchive_list`). It therefore uses `_is_true()`, which accepts
both the raw string and an already-parsed bool — so the formatter is correct whether fed parsed
dicts (the `get_lists` path) or raw RTM dicts (the write-tool path). A naive `== "1"` check broke
the `get_lists` path because the value was already a bool there.

### Timeline Requirement

All write operations require a timeline:

```python
await client.call("rtm.tasks.complete", require_timeline=True, ...)
```

### Transaction Log and Undo

All write tools record their transaction in an in-memory log on `RTMClient` via `record_and_build_response()`. This helper extracts the transaction ID and undoable flag, records the entry, and builds the response envelope in one call:

```python
return record_and_build_response(client, result, data={...}, tool_name="add_task")
```

The transaction log (`client.get_all_transactions()`) enables:
- `get_timeline_info` — inspect the session's full write history
- `batch_undo` — undo multiple operations in reverse chronological order
- `undo` — marks the transaction as undone in the log after successful undo

Key classes:
- `TransactionEntry` (dataclass in `client.py`): `transaction_id`, `method`, `undoable`, `undone`, `summary`
- `record_and_build_response` (in `response_builder.py`): combines `get_transaction_info` + `client.record_transaction` + `build_response`

### Note Body Extraction

RTM stores note body text in `$t` (XML text node) or `body` depending on context. Use `extract_note_body()`:

```python
from rtm_mcp.parsers import extract_note_body
body = extract_note_body(note)  # Handles both "$t" and "body" keys
```

## Testing

Test-writing conventions (the respx + `FakeMCP`/`mock_client` patterns, the read-only
call-surface assertion, strict-tag rejection setup) are canonical in
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) § 8. Run with `make test` (= `uv run pytest`).

### Test-suite inventory

This inventory is the canonical per-file test count (keep it in sync — CONTRIBUTING.md § 9).

Test files (457 tests total):
- `tests/test_client.py` — client signing, API calls, settings + account-tag caching, transaction log, 503 retry, connection retry, POST/GET split (39 tests)
- `tests/test_config.py` — config load/save, file fallback, corrupt JSON, strict-tag toggle (12 tests)
- `tests/test_strict_tags.py` — strict-tag guard: normalize/split/SmartAdd-extract + enforce_strict_tags (off / reject / live-refetch) (12 tests)

### Integration Testing

Use MCP Inspector:

```bash
make inspect
# or
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run rtm-mcp
```

### Manual Testing

```python
# Quick API test
python -c "
import asyncio
from rtm_mcp.config import RTMConfig
from rtm_mcp.client import RTMClient

async def test():
    config = RTMConfig.load()
    client = RTMClient(config)
    result = await client.test_echo()
    print(result)
    await client.close()

asyncio.run(test())
"
```

## Adding New Tools

The canonical step-by-step checklist is [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) § 12 (with the tool
pattern in § 3 and the enriched-docstring shape in § 7). The worked example below shows the
pattern in context.

Example:

```python
from ..lookup import resolve_task_ids
from ..response_builder import build_response, record_and_build_response

@mcp.tool()
async def set_task_location(
    ctx: Context,
    location_id: str,
    task_name: str | None = None,
    task_id: str | None = None,
    taskseries_id: str | None = None,
    list_id: str | None = None,
) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Assign a saved location to a task. Use get_locations to find location IDs.
    Use list_tasks with filter "location:name" to find tasks at a location.

    Identify the task by either task_name or all three IDs.

    Caution: task_name uses fuzzy matching across all tasks. For common names,
    prefer passing task_id + taskseries_id + list_id to avoid matching an
    unintended task.

    Returns:
        {"message": "Location set"} with transaction_id for undo.
    """
    client: RTMClient = await get_client()
    ids = await resolve_task_ids(client, task_name, task_id, taskseries_id, list_id)
    if "error" in ids:
        return build_response(data=ids)

    result = await client.call(
        "rtm.tasks.setLocation",
        require_timeline=True,
        location_id=location_id,
        **ids,
    )

    return record_and_build_response(
        client, result,
        data={"message": "Location set"},
        tool_name="set_task_location",
    )
```

## Deployment

### PyPI Release

```bash
uv build
uv publish
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t rtm-mcp .
docker push ghcr.io/ljadach/rtm-mcp
```

## Common Issues

### "RTM not configured"

Run `rtm-setup` or set environment variables.

### Rate Limiting

Client uses a token bucket (burst to 3, sustain ~0.9 RPS). HTTP 503 responses trigger automatic retry with backoff. Use `get_rate_limit_status` to diagnose. If 503s occur regularly, increase `RTM_SAFETY_MARGIN` (default 0.1).

### Connection Failures

Transient connection errors (TCP timeout, DNS, connection reset) are retried automatically up to `RTM_CONN_MAX_RETRIES` (default 3). Write timeouts are **not** retried to avoid duplicates. Check `connection_retries_last_60s` in `get_rate_limit_status` output.

### Token Expiry

RTM tokens don't expire, but can be revoked. Re-run `rtm-setup` if needed.
